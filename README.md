ruby on rails shop
=================
Here I've done an example of shop which contains 2 pages:
- Main page (including live-loading of products);
- Cart page.

Also, I've done Admin's panel (based on ActiveAdmin) with permission through the /admin page (login: admin@example.com password: password).
You can add new products/categories/etc. there and so on and so forth.

I've implemented shopping cart using localStorage on client side.
